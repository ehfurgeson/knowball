# NBA Player Stats App & Points Predictor

Welcome to the **NBA Stats Flask App & Random Forest Regression** repository! This project is my exploration of several things regarding NBA stats. 

## Player Stats App
First and foremost is the user-friendly Flask app (that currently is not being hosted anywhere sadly, but you should be able to clone this, install dependencies, and run app.py to run it yourself, it is very nice to look at some player's stats, I would recommend)

## Points Predictor
There is also lots of exploration into predicting NBA player performance, this is documented in the notebooks folder, this is still in progress, but so far I have been working on using random forest regression to predicts NBA players' next game points.
