# Critical Bug Fixes Applied

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Division by Zero in Efficiency Chart (app.py:461)
**Problem**: When a player has 0 minutes played, division by zero would crash the application.
**Fix**: Added `.fillna(0)` to handle NaN values from division by zero.

### 2. Undefined Variable in Distribution Charts (app.py:704-712)
**Problem**: Referenced undefined `player_stats` variable in time series chart creation.
**Fix**: Changed to use `data['mean']` from the current stat data and switched from `add_vline` to `add_hline` for correct axis.

## Additional Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Input Validation**: Add validation for all user inputs, especially player names
2. **Error Handling**: Wrap database operations in more specific try-catch blocks
3. **SQL Injection Prevention**: While using parameterized queries, add input sanitization
4. **Environment Variable Validation**: Check all required env vars on startup

### Medium Priority
1. **Logging**: Add more detailed logging for debugging
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
3. **Caching**: Add Redis caching for expensive database operations
4. **Data Validation**: Validate data types and ranges for stats

### Code Quality
1. **Type Hints**: Add Python type hints throughout the codebase
2. **Documentation**: Add docstrings to all functions
3. **Testing**: Create unit tests for critical functions
4. **Linting**: Set up pylint/black for code formatting

## Database Considerations

The Supabase setup is well-designed but consider:
1. **Indexes**: Monitor query performance and add indexes as needed
2. **Backup Strategy**: Set up automated backups
3. **Connection Pooling**: For high traffic, implement connection pooling
4. **Monitoring**: Set up database performance monitoring
